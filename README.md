# A Protocol Write-up for a Randomized Clinical Trial
This project is a practice exercise where I drafted a clinical trial protocol to explore whether adding bevacizumab to second-line therapy improves survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

The write-up walks through the full structure of a trial protocol: background and rationale, study design, objectives, endpoints, sample size calculations, risks and benefits, and operational details like visit schedules and compliance. My goal wasnâ€™t to produce a submission-ready document, but to practice translating scientific evidence into a coherent study plan and to strengthen my skills in clinical research writing and trial design.

Working on this helped me think more critically about how trials are structured, how to balance risks and benefits, and how statistical methods are chosen to match the research question.
